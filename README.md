## Overview

This project is a demonstration of WaveSurfer.js, a customizable audio waveform visualization built on top of Web Audio API and HTML5 Canvas. It provides an interactive interface to visualize audio files with playback control, volume adjustment, and dynamic audio file loading.

## Features

- **Interactive Waveform Visualization**: Utilizes WaveSurfer.js to render audio waveforms that allow users to visually interact with the audio playback.
- **Dynamic Audio File Loading**: Supports loading and switching between multiple audio files dynamically. Includes a set of default audio files for demonstration.
- **Volume Control**: Features a custom slider to control the audio volume, with a visual indicator of the current volume level.
- **Mute Functionality**: Allows users to mute and unmute the audio.
- **Play/Pause Control**: Offers play and pause functionality for the audio playback.
- **Drag and Drop Upload**: Users can drag and drop their MP3 files or use a file picker to upload and play their own audio files.
- **Audio Information Display**: Shows the current playing file's name, current playback time, and total duration.

## Usage

1. **Play/Pause**: Click the play/pause button to start or pause the audio playback.
2. **Change Volume**: Use the volume slider to adjust the playback volume.
3. **Mute/Unmute**: Click the mute button to toggle the sound on and off.
4. **Upload Audio**: Drag and drop an MP3 file onto the designated area or click to upload using the file picker.
5. **Select Audio Track**: Choose from the dropdown menu to switch between the available audio tracks.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more interactive features such as playback speed control.
- Implement more complex waveform visualizations.
- Enhance mobile responsiveness and touch controls.
